This is a living list of software/tools that I have used and found helpful. All of them are available for free or have a freemium version that gets the job done. Most of them are cross platform as well.

1. VS Code Extensions
    1. [Bracket  Pair Colourizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)
    2. [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
    3. [Spell Check](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) : Will help avoid "nit" comments in your pull requests

2. [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) : Monitor, search and edit network requests flowing in and out of your system. Some additional setup required to get it working on Mac & Linux.

3. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) : A valuable tool, given the booming API economy 

4. [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/) : Allows you to practice touch typing. Not looking down at the keyboard for every character has hugely benefited my neck

5. [repl](https://replit.com/) : Test out small snippets of code or toy programs within your browser. There are bunch of other websites that let you do this but repl has support for almost every language and a very neat UI
